# JavaScript and Data Structure Master Class by Colt Steele

- It's important to pay attention to the prerequisites, little text lectures at the beginning of every sections

## Order of the Lecture

### First Section - A Stepping Stone

1. Introduction
2. Big O Notation : Don't skip it!
3. Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects : Nice and short

- Apply the Big O Notation to data structure

4. Problem Solving Approach

- Interview, algorithms and challenges
- When you confront some problems but don't know how to solve
- Setting up the framework free to think, approach the problem

5. Problem Solving Pattern

- About concrete patterns

6. 100% Optional Challenge

7. Recursion (재귀)

- Don't skip it if you are not familiar with recursion

8. Recursion challenges

9. Bonus Recursion Challenge

10. Searching Alogorithms (검색 알고리즘)

- Binary search

11. Bubble Sort (버블 정렬)

12. Selection Sort (선택 정렬)

13. Insertion Sort (삽입 정렬)

14. Comparison between Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort

- A group of intermediate sorting algorithm

15. Merge Sort (합병 정렬)

- Everyone's favourite?

16. Quick Sort

17. Radix Sort (지수 정렬)

### Second Section - Data Structures

18. Intro to Data Structures

23. Tree Traversal (트리 순회)

24. Binary Heaps

- Priority queue

25. Hash Tables

- Understand how JavasScript object work,
  - how they implement behind the scene
  - key-value data structure
- Hashing algorithms

26. Graphs

- GPS mapping
- Storing social network data
- One-way relationship, two-way relationship
- Lots of stuff of graph's networking routing

27. Graph Traversal (그래프 순회)

28. Dijkstra's Algorithm (다익스트라 알고리즘)

- Finding the shortest path between two nodes on a graph
- Relys on
  - Big O Notation
  - Recursion
  - Binary Heap
  - Heap's priority stack, queues
  - graphs
  - and a lot of stuffs that we learned before

29. Dynamic Programming

30. The Wild West

## How to run the code

- JavaScript Snippet inside the browser!

  - Go to Developer's tool of the browser
  - Open Source > Snippets
  - Create a new snippet
  - Write down JavaScript codes
  - Press 'play' or Command+Enter

- Using a browser rather than Terminal and run the code with NodeJS
